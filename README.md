Consistent User Experience
==========================
Author:     Curtis Naphan, Erin Mohr, David Livingston

This is the basic templates of the Consistent User Experience, used to produce static HTML websites using the Consistent User Experience standard. It has a vanilla and a Bootstrap version. The Bootstrap version is mostly the same in terms of structure but supports dropdown menus and single column width mode.

These templates should be polished but not extended beyond basic static HTML/CSS/JS. Anything involving dynamic back-end code or a CMS should be in separate repositories.

These templates are the canonical interpretation of the Consistent User Experience. If there is a difference between some other version and this one, this one should be taken to be correct, unless it's an obvious bug. Where there's a discrepancy between the CUE standard and these templates, the standard should be taken as correct and ideal.
